The approach has some issues that need fixing. Let's go through the main points:

Logical Error in String Replacement: The replace_value.replace(find_pattern, replace_pattern) line does not update replace_value because str.replace()returns a new string but does not modify replace_value in place.

Misunderstanding of replace() Usage: You are currently replacing find_pattern in the replace_value, but replace_value is already the replace_pattern,so this doesn't make sense. Typically, you would be replacing the find_pattern in some text where you expect to find that pattern, not in the replacement pattern itself.

Clarification of Purpose: It seems you're trying to map values like "1" to "X" and "0" to "-" in some target text or data. You need to apply the replacements to the actual data, not just the pattern.

Here's a fixed approach based on what I think you're trying to do:
"""


list1 = "1,0"
list2 = "One,Zero"

# Create find and replace patterns
find_patterns = [p.strip() for p in list1.split(',') if p.strip()]
replace_patterns = [p.strip() for p in list2.split(',') if p.strip()]

# Sample text to apply the replacements
text = "1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1 0 2 2 0"

# Apply find and replace patterns
for find_pattern, replace_pattern in zip(find_patterns, replace_patterns):
    print(f"Find: {find_pattern} Replace: {replace_pattern}")
    
    # Replace find_pattern with replace_pattern in the target text
    text = text.replace(find_pattern, replace_pattern)
    print(f"Updated text: {text}")

# Final result
print(f"Final text: {text}")
"""
Key Fixes:

    Replacing in Target Text: The text.replace() function is applied to a sample text string, which simulates the actual data where you're performing the replacements.
    replace() Returns a New String: Since str.replace() returns a new string, you must assign the result back to the variable holding the text.

This will output the desired text after applying the find-replace mappings.
